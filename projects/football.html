        <h1>Football Playmaker</h1>
        <p>
            This football player maker was a group project, comprised of 4 team members.
            The project was done entirely in QtCreator in C++. Users could place markers for players and animate a pattern that players would move in.
            Users could also view plays which were saved in JSON and upload question banks in CSV format.
